# Copy Relative Path

> Add a new button **"Copy Relative Path"** in a context menu of JuypyterLab.


This extension would be useful when specifying a file path from a notebook you're working on. The "Copy Relative Path" button copies a path relative to an active document; it will hide when an active window does not provide a reference path; i.e. a Launch page and a Console window.
